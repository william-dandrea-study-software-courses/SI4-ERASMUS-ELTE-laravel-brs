Students’ regulation of Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE Regulations Vol. II. 74/C. § ) states that as long as a student presents another student’s work - or at least the significant part of it - as his/her own performance, it will count as a disciplinary fault. The most serious consequence of a disciplinary fault can be dismissal of the student from the University.

## How to use it

1. Prepare your PHP environment. For this, you can download and use the [PHP, Composer installer](https://github.com/totadavid95/PhpComposerInstaller).
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for the client-side assets.
3. Initialize your project by calling `init.bat` on Windows or `init.sh` on Linux. Take a look into them to see what steps execute subsequently!
4. Implement the required application for the assignment!
5. When you are ready to submit your solution, call `php artisan zip` to create statement, to check the project, and create the zip file to upload. The final version can be found in the `zipfiles` folder.
6. Before submission check your project: extract it into a new folder, and start it with `init.bat`/`init.sh`! If it works, then you can submit the zip file (e.g. in Canvas).
